Overview of our visual analytics system integrated with TopicLens. The system initially performs topic modeling and visualizes documents as a scatterplot where the document coordinates are determined by a 2D embedding method and the topic cluster memberships are color-coded.

When moving the TopicLens (shown as a small rectangle), we dynamically recompute the topic model and 2D embedding in real time on those documents captured within the lens, revealing their finer-grained topical structure and their visual overview.
