Users specify these queries by visually selecting regions on the map and connecting them. In addition to inspecting the results depicted on the map, i.e., the dots corresponding to pickups (blue) and dropoffs (orange) of the selected trips, they can also explore the results through other visual representations. The scatter plots below the maps show the relationship between hour of the day and trip duration. Points in the plots are colored according to the spatial constraint represented by the arrows between the regions: trips to JFK in blue, and trips to LGA in red.
