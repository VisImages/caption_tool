The biologist brushed the bottom cluster in AJ (6), identifying that the genes in this cluster are split into two groups in C57, one being similarly regulated over time to AJ (7), the other (8) containing genes not-deregulated (equally regulated) in C57 while upregulated (going up over time) in AJ (6).
