Selections may be used to restrict the input data for the optimization as shown in (a). Based on the problem definition (b), multiple frontiers of pareto optimal points are calculated and written to a dynamic dimension, which can be assigned to visualizations like the bar-chart displayed in (c). In this view, the first pareto frontier has been brushed and is highlighted in linked views ((d), (e)). Subsequent refinement brushes in the parallel coordinates restrict the result set and allow for interactive exploration of additional constraints.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [73, 423, 775, 475], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}]
