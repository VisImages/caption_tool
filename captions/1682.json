Three visualization methods for set-typed data. The picture on the left shows a Venn diagram with four shapes. Each shape de- \ufb01nes an area, where data items that contain a speci\ufb01c element can be placed. A data item containing two elements must be placed in the in- tersection area of the two respective shapes (and outside the other two shapes). To provide room for each possible combination of elements, the edge of a new shape has to intersect each of the currently avail- able areas. This visualization is very intuitive for a small number of shapes, but it becomes confusing very soon when new elements are added. The picture on the right shows a Mosaic plot [3] representing the same dataset. Here the available screen-space is divided recur- sively for each possible element in our set-typed dimension. The size of the two halves represents the number of data records in this rectan- gle. However, large amounts of screen-space are needed for a higher number of elements, and the resulting visualization heavily depends on the order of subdivisions. The picture in the middle displays the same dataset in a set\u2019o\u2019gram. This visualization shows one bar for each pos- sible element in our set-typed dimension. One data record containing multiple elements is represented by multiple bars in the view. The blocks provide additional information on how many other elements are in the sets represented by a block. However, to \ufb01nd out which other elements are contained in these sets, interaction is needed.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [410, 193, 760, 483], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 3, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.06642066420664207, 0.059087835775839315, 0.4612546125461255, 0.3283720930232558], "Caption": "Fig. 2.
