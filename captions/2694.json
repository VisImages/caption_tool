The Trips Explorer highlights regions in time and space of low (in blue) and high (in red) frequency of trips. Here, periods of low frequency are observed at night and high frequency at peak hours. This visualization shows the different starting stations (in the vertical axis) and abrupt supply reduction (shown in white) before 3pm and before the night peak hours. The Stops Explorer allows exploration of the data associated with the stations in a route, including wait time and reliability.
