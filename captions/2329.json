(a)Birth of a new halo H69 enveloping a single satellite halo (particles in white). Glyphs show direction of movement of each particle. (b)Birth of a new halo H134 consisting of a single satellite halo (particles in pink) along with continuation of the existing white halo H69. Blue glyphs on the pink particles show halo H134 moving towards the existing white halo H69. (c)The halo H69 and the halo H134 merge into one halo represented by H69 with two satellite halos (both represented by white particles). (d)Both the satellite halos inside halo H69 eventually merge into one satellite halo represented by white particles. (e)The Halo merger tree shows birth, continuation and merger of halo H69 and halo H134 from time step t138 to t174.
