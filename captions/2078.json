Tag cloud lenses in BirdVis are used as a tool to explore and understand relative habitat preferences suggested by a species distribution model over space, time, and across species. Here, we show occurrence maps for the Indigo Bunting. The lenses cover three different regions on three different dates of the breeding season of 2009: May 4, June 22, and August 24, 2009. They show important differences in habitat preferences across these regions as well as how the preferences change over time within a region. The ability to interact with these visualizations, by changing regions and dates, and comparing different bird species, provides an unprecedented tool for scientists to understand bird distribution and consequently obtain insights about the environment and how it changes over time.
