Visualizations that respect the Principle of Unambiguous Data Depiction make large changes in the data clearly visible. To visualize tensors (b), bas-relief ambiguity makes ellipsoid glyphs for different tensors appear similar (top); superquadric glyphs avoid the problem (bottom). With the Principle of Visual-Data Correspondence, meaningful changes in data should produce analogously meaningful changes in impressions, according to the mathematical structure of both data and visual spaces. In (c) the directed graph\u2019s partial order is unchanged by adding some edges.
