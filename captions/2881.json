Each row represents the mutation counts for each position along the virus\u2019 genome within an individual animal. Sequences are shown in reading order. A color encoding displays the counts in a dense manner. To scale to the viral lengths (size of items), the design uses a summarization strategy (binning) and provides focus+context tools to support close inspection required for key tasks (e.g., inspection and dissection). To scale to larger numbers of individuals, a juxtaposition design is used that supports re-ordering and the selection of any individual (or consensus of set of individuals) as a reference. The choice of different references allows for judgments even at a distance (different references are chosen in the left and right images). The juxtaposition orderings can place related individuals close together, allowing for comparison across groups (colored labels).", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [28, 300, 743, 395], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 5, "Page": 9, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.11864406779661017, 0.04855275443510738, 0.8983050847457628, 0.1942110177404295], "Caption": "Fig. 6. Three of the visual comparison designs used for topic model comparison. Topic model comparison [3] addresses a number of analytic problems, each with different comparison targets and tasks providing different challenges.

(a) To identify similar topics, algorithmic alignment is presented with an explicit encoding that shows only the most important matches (subset). (b) To dissect an identified pair of topics, the word lists for the topics are shown juxtaposed allowing the viewer to scan the lists to see if the differences are semantic. (c) To convey the effects of the differences over the model, a buddy plot uses visual summarization in a juxtaposition design to convey how different document distances are correlated between models. Each row represents the distance to a particular document, every other document is encoded as a circle with the distance in model B in the X coordinate, and the distance in model A in the color.
