As in figure, initially we detect the trending candidates of column genre and singer then put them in the current trending pool. Next, we conduct categorical data trending to deploy the sparse coding. We can obtain the candidate-bases importance by the expansion on the logs with detected trending candidates candidates row summation in A, and get the most important event genre:formed 1 by codeword d1, a.k.a., genre=1 and singer=B.
