Overview of the proposed approach. Standard simulation: A collection of control parameter values is used for a single simulation run to determine and visualize simulation results (extracted scalar features). Ensemble simulation: Design of experiment methods are used to create several collections of control parameters. The resulting output values are aggregated and visualized together with the control parameter values. Automatic optimization: Aggregated parameter values are used to create a regression model which is used for optimization using the de\ufb01ned optimization constraints. This approach is usually decoupled from visual analysis, or visualization is used to show optimization results only. Complex simulation results: All complex simulation results are visualized. Ensemble steering: During visual exploration additional control parameter values for new simulation runs are selected by means of visualization. Hybrid steering: A uni\ufb01ed approach which enables the exploration of parameters, complex results, extracted features and optimization results. Furthermore, it uses results from automatic optimization to guide the user during interactive visual steering. The hybrid steering also supports regression model building and optimization constraints and goals speci\ufb01cation, all within the same framework.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [62, 321, 777, 453], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 2, "Page": 3, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.09058823529411765, 0.4318181818181818, 0.8976470588235295, 0.5445454545454546], "Caption": "Figure 2.
