In general, visual analytics is the process of transforming input data into insight. A similar process occurs for the uncertainty. First, uncertainty modeling generates a model for source uncertainty. As data is transformed, these uncertainties are propagated and aggregated. We obtain such estimates via sensitivity and error modeling. Finally, the uncertainty on the derived data and its sources are mapped to visual representations, which finally populate the view used by the analyst.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [73, 321, 775, 373], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 3, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.5176470588235295, 0.06727272727272728, 0.9105882352941177, 0.2881818181818182], "Caption": "Figure 2: Modeling the uncertainty of variables using Gaussian Mix- ture Models (GMM) for 4 different variables.
