The methods can be summarized as: 1) the opening presen- tation establishes creativity principles; 2) an analogy introduction pro- motes interpersonal leveling; 3) wishful thinking elicits opportunities for visualization; 4) barrier removal explores those opportunities further; 5) lunch & excursion provides time for rest and incubation; 6) visualiza- tion analogies allows specification of requirements by example; 7) sto- ryboarding summarizes key ideas in a graphic form; and 8) the reflective discussion highlights potentially interesting ideas for workshop analysis.
