Every user, regardless of training, is immediately drawn to the left, right, top and bottom re- gions of this StickWRLD diagram. These residues are in fact contact- ing. The surprising ease with which this hypothesis can be reached visually, and the surprising reliability of the hypotheses generated this way, belies the tremendous difficulty encountered in making the same types of predictions on purely statistical grounds. For visual tractability in printed form, this figure is drawn from Archaeal tRNAs. Residue identities and propensities are indicated by colored spheres around the periphery. Positive and Negative associations between residues are shown by white and red lines. The diameter of the lines indicates the strength of the association. The live visualization is ac- tually an interactive explorable 3-dimensional data space.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [440, 570, 775, 766], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 2, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.5164705882352941, 0.07181818181818182, 0.9141176470588235, 0.4690909090909091], "Caption": "Figure 2: These diagrams show StickWRLD visualizations for the correlated mutations within Adenylate Kinase.

While it is far less obvious in a small image on paper, the user\u2019s eye is immediately drawn to the dense cluster of correlation lines to the right side of the circle, then to the more diffuse region of vertical correlation lines at the left of the circle, and finally to the diagonals from the top of the left bundle into the dense right bundle, and from the bottom of the left bundle to the dense bundle.
