Analysis of the healthy brain aging dataset. We generate factors for the 7 types of features (a). Each factor represents 45 dimensions (the number of brain regions). We observe the profile plots for these seven factors (b). The profile plots for number of voxels and volume (1 and 2) reveal that these two features are identical, thus we discard one of them. One of the factors (4) has a varied correlation relation with the underlying dimensions and another factor (7) is a strong representative of the statistics over the brain regions. For each brain region, we limit the features to these two and apply MDS on this subset of dimensions (c). The MDS reveals a tightly inter-related group of dimensions that is found to be associated with the Cerebellum Cortex (CerCtx). CerCtx is represented by a medoid factor and the rest with projection factors. These factors, each representing a brain region, are visualized on a pValshp vs. %out plot (d). 6 of the \u201cmost normally\u201d distributed factors are selected. PCA is applied on the participants. We notice a group of individuals with outlying values (e) and find out that this group consists of elderly subjects (f).
