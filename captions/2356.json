One of the key advantages of the large display is that we can use the actual contents of the document rather than a reduced information representation such as a dot, icon, scaled image, or title. While these representations may serve as visual reminders, they encourage analysts to rely on their memory of the contents through the reliance on explicit interaction that is required to access them [22]. By providing the full text documents, we are providing more visual cues as to the contents of the document, and providing access to the contents purely though physical navigation. This approach also encourages the analyst to think of the documents as physical objects since they closely resemble printed cards or pieces of paper.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [439, 223, 775, 436], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 2, "Page": 5, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.08, 0.6681818181818182, 0.48, 0.860909090909091], "Caption": "Figure 3 An entity showing internal links to instances in a document (green line), as well as links to other open documents (gray lines).", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [66, 954, 406, 981], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 3, "Page": 6, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.5682352941176471, 0.06818181818181818, 0.8858823529411765, 0.32181818181818184], "Caption": "Figure 4 Timeline using offsets to mark different threads.
