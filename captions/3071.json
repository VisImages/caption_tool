EnsembleLens facilitates the exploration of anomaly detection algorithms via three levels of analysis, namely, (a) the overview as the macro level, (b) the correlation matrix view as the meso level, and (c) the ranking view as the micro level. (d) is for the validation. The figure showcases the analytic process based on the Wisconsin-Breast Cancer (Original) dataset with 699 instances and 10 attributes. First, (a) and (b) indicate that LOF (C7, C8) and ABOD (C11, C12) have little correlation with the others because the ensemble components generated by them are far from the major cluster, and the correlation matrix also shows their low correlation with the others (i.e., few crossing lines, many blue bars around the glyph). (c1) illustrates that the iForest algorithm has better performance for this dataset than LOF (c2), as most top-ranked points in (c1) are proved to be anomalous. By contrast, the top-ranked points in LOF (c2) are normal and consistent.
