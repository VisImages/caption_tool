Participants were given a target time series, and then had to judge the similarity of the target to a potential match, to which an invariant had been applied. Heterogeneity of human responses show that not all changes to time series result in perceived difference across all viewers. Values are not comparable across conditions, however, slopes are significant: a negative slope represents a sensitivity (similarity falls as the factor increases), while a horizontal line suggests an invariance. This same dataset was then applied to the matching algorithms we present in this paper. Algorithms had varying slopes across the invariants, showing different initial affordances. For instance, additive noise has a significant negative effect on perceived match strength (negative slope). However, only Hough Voting and MSE matching algorithms share a significant negative slope in their match quality as noise is added. Hough Voting and MSE therefore match human judgments of similarity with respect to noise, whereas DTW is invariant to this factor.
