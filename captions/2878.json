The user interactively selects a range of text specifying a hypothesis about the model in the Select View (a). This range is then used to match similar hidden state patterns displayed in the Match View (b). The selection is made by specifying a start-stop range in the text (c) and an activation threshold (t) which leads to a selection of hidden states (blue lines). The start-stop range can be further constrained using the pattern plot (d). The meta-tracks below depict extra information per word position like POS (e1) or the top K predictions (e2). The tool can then match this selection with similar hidden state patterns in the data set of varying lengths (f), providing insight into the representations learned by the model. The match view additionally includes user-defined meta-data encoded as heatmaps (g1,g2). The color of one heatmap (g2) can be mapped (h) to the word matrix (f) which allows the user to see patterns that lead to further refinement of the selection hypothesis.
