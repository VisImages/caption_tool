The points have been colored according to protein content, where the color bar indicates the particular coding. Note that lighter points, with higher values, are located towards the right, in the direction of the axis vector. Additionally, since the estimates for protein are the (orthogonal) projections of the points onto its labeled axis, ideally they should be located inside the gray area.
