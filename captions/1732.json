Our experience with the VAST 2008 competition has reinforced our belief in the need for analytic platforms, not products. Openness and flexibility are key to being able to cope with the demands of a broad range of analytic tasks. In addition to our existing open APIs and open XML formats, our pluggable architecture enables users to design custom analysis tools and helpers that will be seamlessly integrated into the analysts\u2019 workspace, enabling advanced visualization solutions for increasingly complex analytical challenges.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [436, 370, 749, 603], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 2, "Page": 2, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.11764705882352941, 0.0890909090909091, 0.44705882352941184, 0.3009090909090909], "Caption": "Figure 1: A silenced communication network With relevant information on graph, the next step is to use the Histogram for statistical analysis.
