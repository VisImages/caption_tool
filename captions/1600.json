The spectrum of the aftersound of a polyphonic overtone cluster, a), is analyzed for two values of Ftest , and shows the the presence of overtones with funda- mentals near b) 65.4 Hz and c) 138.6 Hz. In c) the odd and even partials related to the fundamental at 65.4 Hz reappear, grouped separately in space. Because the fundamentals are not related by a factor of two, one set of partials systematically deviates from the reference lines at y=0 and y=1/2 in c), while the other set agrees (for low partial numbers only) with the target model along the x-axis. The curvature is due to inharmonicity of the partials.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [440, 376, 775, 510], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}]
