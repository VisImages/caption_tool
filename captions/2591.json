A person\u2019s emotional pro\ufb01le on a timeline visualized by PEARL derived from his tweets, of which volumes are shown as the blue background.

Thus, from the emotion band visual representation, we can observe that this person has an overall positive, calm, and neutrally dominant emotional outlook, and is primarily in the moods of anticipation, joy, and trust. In addition, he has had just a few emotional ups and downs (low volatility) except during July.
