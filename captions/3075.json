The anomaly time series (1) on top displays the time series and anomalies of the trade attributes and stability measures for a selected country. The choropleth view (2) along with the small multiple maps (3) display the first order trade relationships centering on selected countries. The colored bars below each small multiple map show the temporal correlation of the selected trade measure to the stability measure. The clustering view (4) displays the hierarchical clustering for the countries, based on either the triadic similarity or top partner similarity. The groups can also be configured to show the average triad distributions (as (6)) and other measures. The trade diffusion graph (5) displays the propagation effect of anomalies.
