(a) This figure shows an interactive dendrogram where node at- tributes like node\u2019s shape and color are mapped to Cumulus while their corresponding edge colors are mapped to Planetary boundary layer(PBL) parameterization schemes. It provides insight on uncertainty with reference to parameterization schemes. The pattern in this dendrogram draws towards an insight that uncertainty is primarily driven by cumulus followed by PBL. Color Brewer scheme \u201cSet1\u201d is used for encoding categorical qualitative data like parameters belonging to parameterization schemes.[1] (b) This shows the spatial uncertainty between ensemble members 8, 14 and 22 based on the insights gained in the overview space. The pairwise comparisons of ensemble members (8, 22) and (14, 22), exhibit greater uncertainty compared to the pairwise comparison of ensemble members (8, 14). It presents spatial characteristics of uncertainty using knowledge gained from the insight in the analysis phase (a). The color Brewer scheme \u201cReds\u201d is used to encode sequential quantitative scalar spatial data. The color scale for ensemble members and pairwise comparisons is different even though we used the same color scheme to encode spatial data. The color scale for pairwise comparisons is normalized to its timestep.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [73, 386, 775, 530], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}]
