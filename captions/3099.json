Example of a MotionRug applied to swarm data comprising 151 golden shiner fish swimming through a water tank. Each frame of the data is represented as one vertical slice, and all slices are aligned sequentially on a time axis. The color encodes the speed of the fish, leading to this visual representation. We selected six frames that indicate the overall states and movement of the fish, as shown above the MotionRug. Below the MotionRug, we highlight key areas of the visualization: Overall, there is a strong spatial dynamic at the beginning. First, the fish are slow as they approach the right wall of the tank. Then, the fish speed up slowly and slow down when hitting the next wall. The fish repeat this behavior when approaching the wall on the left. Arrived, the fish show a spatial stagnation, meaning as a whole, the group remains in one place. Trends are typically indicated by tapered feature values. Abstract\u2014Understanding the movement patterns of collectives, such as flocks of birds or fish swarms, is an interesting open research question. The collectives are driven by mutual objectives or react to individual direction changes and external influence factors and stimuli. The challenge in visualizing collective movement data is to show space and time of hundreds of movements at the same time to enable the detection of spatiotemporal patterns. In this paper, we propose MotionRugs, a novel space efficient technique for visualizing moving groups of entities. Building upon established space-partitioning strategies, our approach reduces the spatial dimensions in each time step to a one-dimensional ordered representation of the individual entities. By design, MotionRugs provides an overlap-free, compact overview of the development of group movements over time and thus, enables analysts to visually identify and explore group-specific temporal patterns. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in the field of fish swarm analysis and report on initial feedback of domain experts from the field of collective behavior.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [61, 354, 711, 575], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 3, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.03571428571428571, 0.043743078626799554, 0.9502551020408163, 0.2707749766573296], "Caption": "Fig. 2.
