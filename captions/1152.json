The Hierarchical Clustering Explorer (HCE) The rank-by-feature framework is implemented as two new tab windows in HCE 3.0. The main view is the dendrogram view where users can interactively explore hierarchical clustering results [16]. Whenever users identify an interesting projection in the rank-by-feature framework, they can generate a separate child window that will interactively coordinate with all other views in HCE 3.0. A 2D scatterplot ordering result (section 3.2) by correlation coefficient is shown with the U.S. counties data set (section 4). The high-rank 2D projections (or scatterplots) and low-rank 2D projections are shown in separate views together with the clustering result view and histogram views. Five counties that have a high poverty level and low income level are selected in a scatter plot view and they are all highlighted in other views (with black triangles).", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [83, 600, 765, 688], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 4, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.0988235294117647, 0.6436363636363637, 0.9011764705882352, 0.8163636363636364], "Caption": "Figure 2.
