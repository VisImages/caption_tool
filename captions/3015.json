DimReader explains non-linear dimensionality reduction methods by illustrating the effects of user-designed perturbations of the input dataset. It provides an answer to the question \u201cif the input data had been slightly different in a particular way, how would the plot have changed?\u201d. In the case of traditional scatterplots, it recovers exactly the axis lines being displayed. In the case of non-linear methods, DimReader recovers generalized axes, which indicate how dimensions of interest behave. Examples of these axes are shown in (A) for the x, y, and z dimensions of the S Curve (an S shaped 3 dimensional manifold). These axes also allow for the comparison of different projection methods. This is exemplified in (B), where the petal length axis of the iris dataset is shown for three projections. Petal length is well behaved in t-SNE but not in the other projections . We also provide a technique for discovering good perturbations of the input (perturbations that change the projection the most). The top of (C) shows an example of a discovered perturbation. In context, shown at the bottom of (C), this perturbation shows us that t-SNE is sensitive to flat shoes v.s. heels. The perturbation wants to change the original image from a heel to a flat by filling in the arch.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [73, 423, 724, 557], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 2, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.03571428571428571, 0.04497518610421836, 0.9502551020408163, 0.2530345471521942], "Caption": "Fig. 2.
