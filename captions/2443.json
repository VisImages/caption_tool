Our visual design for the analysis of a clustered supergraph. The similarity view (a) shows two clustering settings: an active one which serves as a basis for visualizing the graph and an additional one with possibly changed parameters.

Nodes represent clusters abstracting subgraphs with a similar behavior over time and edges re\ufb02ect connections between these clusters. Nodes are visualized as glyphs showing small time plots that represent the temporal trend of the associated cluster as well as its color-coded intra-cluster similarity. The temporal trends are visualized in more detail in the time series view (c) by a multi-scale time plot for each visible cluster in the network view.
