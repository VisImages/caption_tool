Without appropriate visual cues to help users \u2018observe\u2019 facts in a visualization, these systems impose upon the user the added responsibility of mentally mapping system-generated data facts back to the visualization. Second, given a data fact, there may be more than one visualization that could be used to illustrate the fact (e.g., a pie chart can also be used to illustrate the last two data facts in Figure 1). Similarly, given a visualization and a data fact, the visualization can be embellished in multiple ways to effectively highlight the fact (e.g., changing opacity, adding stroke, enlarging labels). Choosing the right combination of visualization and embellishments is particularly important when sharing or communi- cating data facts since this may have a strong effect on the audiences\u2019 understanding.
