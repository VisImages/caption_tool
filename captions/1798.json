The activities connecting into the query sequence are drawn as connecting nodes in the bottom of the interface, while the activities connecting out of the query are drawn as nodes in the top of the interface. All nodes are ordered by signi\ufb01cance score from left to right. Each node has a label showing the activity code describing it and its frequency of occurrence. Frequency of occurrence is also mapped to the opacity of the edges.
