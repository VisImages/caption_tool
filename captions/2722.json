RCloud is an environment in which hackers and scripters solve problems in data and visual analytics and create web applications and services. It is a shared environment, in which discoverability is a concern. RCloud supports search, annotation, recommendation, and commenting for all notebooks, and provides an overview where users can browse popular and recent analyses. When problems and data sources change frequently, deployment can become very costly; RCloud supports transparent and automatic deployment of analyses as web pages and web services, allowing a seamless transition from data exploration to production.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [73, 419, 775, 479], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 3, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.16705882352941176, 0.06636363636363636, 0.8294117647058823, 0.17454545454545456], "Caption": "Figure 2: A diagram of RCloud\u2019s architecture.
