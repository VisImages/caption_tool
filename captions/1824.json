(a) Each row represents a record, showing its ID on the left. Each record contains several types of events, listed below its ID. Each type is color-coded, and each instance of event is represented by a colored triangle on the time line. The white vertical band represents the alignment line (aligned by Radiology Contrast in orange triangles). A thick black line with the label 1 M to the right represents one month after the alignment. The combo box to the top right indicates that each finer tick represents a day. The two records in orange gradient (001768 and 0000540) indicate that they are currently selected. A temporal summary is shown in (b). The label on the left indicates that it is showing the distribution of the event type CREAT-H, which is in red. Each red bar indicates how many events of that type are there in that day. The combo box on top of (b) indicates that we are aggregating events. By changing its value, we can dynamically aggregate by other metrics (e.g. records, or events per record). The transparent blue box in (b) show that the user has drawn a box there to select all records that have at least one CREAT-H event in the time the box indicates. The selected records are highlighted in orange gradient in (a), and the total number of selected records are in blue on the top panel of (a). Below (b) is a range slider that can be used to pan and zoom both (a) and (b) in coordination. To the right is the control panel. (c) shows the controls and the current state of Align, Rank, and Filter. (d) shows additional controls for temporal summary, and also for navigating groups. Group creation and other controls are wedged between (c) and (d).", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [28, 620, 749, 780], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 3, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.05203045685279188, 0.0586046511627907, 0.49619289340101524, 0.20930232558139536], "Caption": "Fig. 2.
