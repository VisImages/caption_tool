The data shown is the catch weight of the cod fisheries off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. GTdiff has been used in this example to highlight the collapse of the fisheries (i.e., the reduction in catch weight as identified by the red regions in the difference graphs and the small number and size of the yellow spheres that represent the catch data from the end of the temporal range in relation to the blue spheres that represent the catch data from the beginning of the temporal range).", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [73, 408, 775, 486], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}]
