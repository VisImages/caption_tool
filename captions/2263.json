The figure shows a diffusion of information on Twitter regarding a recent 6.8 magnitude earthquake and a series of aftershocks and tsunamis that hit the northern coast of Hokkaido island (a demo on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHYU66Z-4FM). The event caught global attention because the location was one of the areas in northeast Japan devastated by last year\u2019s disaster. Other countries, including Australia, were initially concerned about the Pacific-wide tsunami threat triggered by the earthquake. Our visualization \u201cWhisper\u201d traced this event in real time. In this figure, original tweets are placed at the center of a circle and pathways are created to connect to geo-groups once the tweets got re-broadcasted (retweeted) by the groups. The retweeting activity is shown as a sequence of color-coded retweet glyphs moving along pathways indicating the timing and sentiments of the retweets. The numbering annotations from 0 to 8 correspond to major design components and functionality which will be described in detail in the paper.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [75, 496, 723, 600], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 3, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.5152284263959391, 0.5290116243584212, 0.9733502538071066, 0.6772093023255814], "Caption": "Fig. 2.
