Sub-networks are arranged horizontally, using a modified treemap bar chart representation. Each bar represents a sub-network (n1 , n2 , . . .), showing its nodes; both the node size and the bar length are proportional to the total number of vulnerabilities of the element. Bars are sorted by length and while the user is scrolling into the main pane (A), the pane (B) maintains the visual context. The leftmost part of each bar (a) contains nodes with zero vulnerabilities that are represented as squares of fixed dimension. Mouse-hovering a node (b) reveals its CVSS scores and the number of vulnerabilities. Nodes are selectable individually or by sub-network into the main pane and by uniform and statistical intervals of their scores in the selection pane (D). Selected nodes are listed in (C); their vulnerabilities are presented on a frequency plot (E) and filterable by scores (F). Further selections on the frequency plot are listed in (I), allowing for comparing vulnerability scores on a radar diagram (G) or inspecting numerical scores and accessing the CVE reference page (H). The approximated optimal fixing strategy (J) is automatically computed using the attack graph information and VULNUS allows the security manager to interactively simulate the vulnerabilities fixing in order to explore suboptimal variants of the fixing plan.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [73, 494, 724, 649], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 6, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.08050847457627118, 0.04994185691656068, 0.4406779661016949, 0.1569186011026072], "Caption": "Fig. 2: Encoding node type and scores on the node 31. a) the base score is encoded by a red sliding windows that progressively covers the node blue background and it is in the fourth level (range [6, 8)); b) the target environmental score is encoded by the sliding window red color and it is in the fourth level (range [6, 8]); c) the exploitability bar-gram shows that about 25% of the vulnerabilities have a very high exploitability (black, range [8, 10]); d) the yellow triangle classify the node as a target node; e) the pink upwards arrow indicates the Target Environmental has increased with respect to the last scan.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [28, 176, 379, 304], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 2, "Page": 6, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.5444915254237288, 0.04994185691656068, 0.9067796610169492, 0.19047619047619047], "Caption": "Fig. 3: Detail of the vulnerabilities spread on the network.
