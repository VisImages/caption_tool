Scatterplot designs (shown in columns) have varying levels of support for viewer tasks based on the data characteristics (rows). Here, we compare a traditional scatterplot (left column) to a hexagonal binning implementation [11] (middle) to a Splatterplot [49] (right) for three representative datasets. The appropriateness of a scatterplot design is based on the characteristics of the data and the design\u2019s support of the viewer\u2019s task (such as identifying outliers or comparing distributions). For random distributions with few points (top row), the traditional scatterplot (left) describes the data plainly. With increasing numbers of points (middle row), aggregation representations such as binning (center) communicate spatial density. With overlapping distributions (bottom row), density-based representations communicate overlap and can also show outliers (right), which disappear in the binned representation (middle).", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [63, 511, 714, 606], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 3, "Type": "Table", "Imagebbox": [0.4987244897959184, 0.048886637616897564, 0.9502551020408163, 0.3772175536881419], "Caption": "Table 1.
