We explored the use of maps based on their popularity in previous work [18, 25]. We conjectured that maps may be appropriate for buildings in a shared neighbourhood, such as a university campus, even though that encod- ing may be less appropriate for building portfolios spanning large ge- ographic areas. However, after interviews with energy workers, we realized that maps are better suited for presenting coarse aggregate summary values of energy performance to a casual observer, and they are less appropriate for recurring analysis work; to view energy be- haviour varying over time, animating or faceting the map would be necessary. Furthermore, an energy worker overseeing a portfolio of buildings is already likely to be familiar with the locations of build- ings in her portfolio, and their relative locations are not informative. While using a map to encode energy data was found to be inappro- priate for the tasks that we characterized, an interactive map may be an effective means to filter a portfolio by building location, which we considered in our sandbox environment shown in Figure 2.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [29, 294, 379, 615], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 7, "Page": 7, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.5012755102040817, 0.5347165971310676, 0.9502551020408163, 0.7236227824463118], "Caption": "Fig. 7.

In- stead, we considered how an energy worker would navigate between these views shown on separate displays. Beginning with the matrix and auxiliary boxplots, the energy worker can perform the Overview task, select units of interest, and filter or aggregate buildings in the portfolio. If the currently selected unit of interest is consumption or intensity, selecting a column of the matrix directs the energy worker to juxtaposed faceted and stacked bar charts that include every build- ing from the matrix and spanning the time period corresponding to the selected column. For demand data, the energy worker is directed to faceted and stacked line charts.
