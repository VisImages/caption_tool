The ErbB signaling pathway (the focus pathway) is a target of the drugs Lapatinib and Erlotinib that are used for cancer treatment. As shown in the pathway list on the left that results from a query for similar pathways, the ErbB signaling pathway is related to many cancer pathways. A signaling cascade from ErbB2 to Ras is selected. The integrated enRoute view shows copy number and mRNA expression data for breast cancer cell lines. The sensitivity of the different cell lines to Lapatinib and Erlotinib is reported at the top. For the shown cell lines, increased copy numbers of ErB2 (high red bars in the ErbB2 row) result in over-expression of this gene (high blue bars). Furthermore, there is a strong relation between ErbB2 over-expression and sensitivity to Lapatinib (high blue bars for gene over-expression in the ErbB2 row coincide with low bars in the Lapatinib row). This means that Lapatinib is effective if ErbB2 is highly expressed. There are, however, two exceptions - the highlighted cell lines (gold and orange), for which an under-expression in Ras downstream in the pathway is observed, likely causing Lapatinib to be ineffective in these cases. While this observation was made for breast cancer tissue, exploring the related context pathways by setting the focus node to Ras reveals that the same signaling cascade (i.e., path) is also contained in the non-small cell lung cancer pathway. Thus, it would be interesting to explore the transferability of the observed resistance pattern to this tissue type.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [29, 376, 746, 520], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 7, "Page": 9, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.1016949152542373, 0.0638953452886537, 0.9131355932203389, 0.34916666311811106], "Caption": "Fig. 8.
