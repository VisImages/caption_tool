Example trial in which participants reported whether there were more alien animal sightings early or late in the day (left) and colormaps constructed from four color scales tested on black and white backgrounds in Experiment 1 (right). In the example trial, the right side of the colormap is darker, the color scale is oriented so dark is high in the legend, and the legend text is positioned so \u201cgreater\u201d is high in the legend. However, the side of the colormap that was darker, the orientation of the color scale in the legend (dark\u2013high or light\u2013high), and the position of the text in the legend (\u201cgreater\u201d\u2013high or \u201cfewer\u201d\u2013high) were independently varied in the experiment. Thus, participants had to interpret the legend on every trial to know the correct answer. The datasets used to generate the colormaps also varied across trials (see Experiment 1 Methods for details).", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [60, 358, 710, 453], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}, {"ImageID": 1, "Page": 2, "Type": "Figure", "Imagebbox": [0.511864406779661, 0.04745657568238213, 0.9642857142857143, 0.24463118580765641], "Caption": "Fig. 2.
