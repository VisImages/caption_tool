Various aspects of the symposia are shown at once in this visualiza- tion, among them: (1) important keywords and all the papers under them, (2) related research areas, (3) citations, (4) authors, (5) references, (6) important authors, (7) important papers, and (8) important external papers. This visualization can be used for two purposes: (1) specifics and (2) overview. For specifics, the user focuses one aspect of the visualization. For example, if the user is interested in the two important papers and their citations, they just have to mentally focus on the two large circles and the red and orange lines. For overview, the user looks at the display, with no particular focus, and gets a general impression of the history of the Infovis Symposia.", "DPI": 100, "CaptionBB": [73, 794, 775, 877], "first_confirmed": false, "second_confirmed": false}]
